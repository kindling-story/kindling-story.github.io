                    <h1>An Unordered Collection</h1>
                    <p>| <i>“It is not one voice, but a chorus arguing with itself. Each page insists its own truth, even as the next undoes it”</i></p>
                    <p>
                        A large set of many volumes varying in size and construction, and a plethora of smaller individual papers. Some are wrapped in cloth, others in pressed bark. The papers both separate and bound vary in thickness and texture. Many are water-swollen, ink bleeding.
                        <br>
                        Discovered in a house apart from the village. Stacked floor to ceiling, on shelves and slopes and any surface with strength to carry. Boxes overflowing and piles collapsing, there are is more than a lifetime’s paper to contend with.
                        <br>
                        Conditions vary wildly, affected by their location within the house and the care put into their construction.

                        Yet to catalogue
                        <br><br>
                        This collection speaks with authority but not certainty. There is truth in their scattered pages, obscured by many contexts, but much speculation too. I find comfort in their confusion. Their errors are warm, human. Their voices, though long extinguished, still argue in the dark.
