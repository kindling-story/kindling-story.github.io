                    <h1>Genesis</h1>
                    <p>| <i>“Discovered very soon after I awoke, but not recorded for many months before I learned to write. A stone pillar mid-engraving stood with chunk of damaged bark beside it. The bark contains a passage that was begin transferred to the stone”</i></p>
                    <p>From the dark, fire leapt forth, the first flames wandering across the waste. Embers kissed the stones, and from their warmth the first man arose.
                        <br>
                        Ashen was his face, for the ground remained unyielding, and the silence weighed upon him. He wandered in immense suffering, until the weight of existence bowed him low.
                        <br>
                        Round a cairn he withered, his flame returning to grey. Yet from his torment sprang the first flower, a solitary sprout, stubbornly drawing water from the barren soil. Its roots whispered of life yet to come.
                        <br>
                        The dark cast forth more children, who beheld the first’s sacrifice. Each torch they bore held within it a spark of that first warmth. And wherever they fell, the stone drank, the moss spread, and a subtle blanket of life crept across the land.
                        <br>
                        The Earth released no more fire, for the first flame had been given entirely to the soil. All that remained was the torchlight carried in each child - small, fragile, yet enough to kindle life through their passing.
                        <br>
                        Through solitude, through suffering, through death, the world grew. Every life left behind traces—footsteps pressed into stone, whispers in the air, marks on walls. Life is not sudden, nor given freely; it is built in quiet layers, one lonely spark at a time.
                        <br>
                        It continues. The torchlight is carried still in each of us. Every act, every step, every offering of warmth contributes to the slow weaving of life. From sacrifice comes growth. From memory comes the garden. From loneliness comes Kindling.</p>
